## How to run this pipeline

Step 1: Clone the repository using the following ssh key:

git clone git@github.com:CarolinaOliveira001/courtlet_pipeline.git

Step 2: Open the file which appeared from the previous step. Its name is the name of this pipeline "courtlet_pipeline".

Step 3: Build the image (run this command in the same folder as step 2):

docker build -t pipe_court .

Step 3: You can now run the pipeline with the following command after changing "/absolute/path/" to the path on your machine:

docker run --rm --name court_container -v /absolute/path/courtlet_pipeline/courtcases/:/home/courtcases:rw pipe_court

If everything went well, you can open the "courtcases" folder and see one barplot inside and one file.

## Description of this pipeline

This pipeline will clean every column from the court data. The court data comes from the courtlet package. Then it creates a 
plot named "plot_vote_Roe". This plot is a barplot which shows the number of minority votes vs the number of majority votes 
for the case "Roe v. Wade". Finally, it saves a description of the "Roe v. Wade" case in a text file. Both the plot and the
text file will be saved in the "courtcases" folder.

This whole pipeline was made for my university R course from Dr. Bruno Andr√© Rodrigues Coelho. This pipeline can be upgraded any 
time, so always keep an eye on the updates.
